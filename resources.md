## Sticky Note Feedback - CEFP June Training Week Skills Swap Session

### Green Stickies

- Now I have a starting idea of what GitHub is. I can sense that it may be easy to use after more practice
- I loved learning about GitHub - such a well-paced, thorough, exciting intro. I am full of good questions about how this could help me.
- Making a GitHub page was something new I learned
- This was awesome! I'm inspired to make my personal webpage using GitHub!
- How easy GitHub pages is now (I had totally overcomplicated it)
- I had no idea that there were templates for GitHub Pages!
- Unlocked a ton of possibilities for me in GitHub! I didn't know any of that and it's been perfect!!!
- I literally knew none of this! 100% more knowledge acquired! - Julianna
- Learnt what GitHub is and how it can be used.
- Learned new: EVERYTHING awesome! Believe it or not, but even though I work at CZI, this was my first GitHub experience :heart: :heart:
- Woohoo! GitHub Pages are SO MUCH EASIER now - thanks for teaching!
- Feel empowered to make a collaborative website!
- Oh my god I haven't made a website since I was 13!


### Pink Stickies

- Is it just used to create websites?
- not sure what to do next to figure out how this would work for me. Scared of branching and pulling, but don't want to stop learning!!
- I'm a little intimidated by the GitHub platform. Also, it would be cool to run through a repository example with a collaborator to get a more realistic sense of how it works
- How do I merge my pages in my project with a forked theme?
- nothing. you are all wonderful 
- Help figuring out what types of files can be merged
- the themes could use more explanation
- Once I forked a theme from Jekyll, it wasn't clear how to apply it to my test page
- I think people who code have a different view of reality than I! :grimacing: 
- Where do I find the sample webpages, i.e. Jekyll?
- didn't fully understand how to customise the page and how to use GitHub collaboratively
- Don't know enough to know what to do better..?
- A little confused about how all the various pages & master integrate
- Private repos - for up to 3 users each - interesting... why did they make this change? How can I get some coding street cred? Thank you all instructors
